# Test1

So this exercise aims to put into practice the concepts we learned in the first two parts of this course on Git and Github.

we must create a simple Git repository containing:

  - A file named "README.txt" which presents the project;
  - At least 2 other files of your choice (they can contain code scripts, text on a personal project ...);
  - At least 4 distinct commits showing the addition and modification of some files.
